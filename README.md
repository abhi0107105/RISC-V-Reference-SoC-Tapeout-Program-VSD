# RISC-V-Reference-SoC-Tapeout-Program-VSD

🚀 VSD SoC Tapeout Program
My repository chronicles my hands-on experience in the VSD System-on-Chip Tapeout Program. It serves as a detailed log, tracking my progress on a weekly basis.

🧠 Core Concepts & Technologies
Before diving into the weekly tasks, it's crucial to understand the foundational pillars of this program. The journey from a hardware description language to a physical chip layout (GDSII) involves several key stages and technologies. This project heavily relies on:

The RTL-to-GDSII Flow: A comprehensive understanding of the entire ASIC design flow, including RTL design, verification, synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and final signoff checks.
Open-Source EDA Tooling: Proficiency with a suite of powerful open-source tools is essential. This includes simulators like Icarus Verilog, synthesis tools like Yosys, and layout tools like Magic.
Hardware Description Languages (HDLs): Using Verilog to describe digital circuits in a way that can be understood, simulated, and synthesized.
🗓️ Module 1: Environment Setup
This initial phase covers the installation and verification of the essential tools required for the entire digital design flow.

Week 0	⚙️Toolchain Installation Iverilog, Yosys, GTKWave	✔️ Completed

✨ Core Takeaways from Week 0
Successfully configured and validated the necessary open-source EDA toolchain.
Established a foundational development environment for the digital design workflow.
The system is now fully prepared for the complete RTL-to-GDSII design process.

🙌 Recognition
A special thank you to Kunal Ghosh and the entire team at VLSI System Design (VSD) for making this invaluable learning opportunity possible through the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program. Gratitude is also extended to RISC-V International, the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), the VLSI Society of India (VSI), and Efabless for their crucial support of this initiative.
