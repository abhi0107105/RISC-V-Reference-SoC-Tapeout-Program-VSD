## üöÄ VSD SoC Tapeout Program

The VSD SoC Tapeout Program is part of a national effort to build hands-on semiconductor expertise among students and practitioners using open source tools, real foundry PDKs, and modern ASIC flows. It is run by VLSI System Design (VSD) in collaboration with stakeholders like RISC-V International, Efabless, ISM (India Semiconductor Mission), etc.
